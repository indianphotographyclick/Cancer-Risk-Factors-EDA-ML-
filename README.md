# Cancer-Risk-Factors-EDA-ML
A compact and standardized dataset examining how lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors influence five common cancer types.
Contains 2,000 individual records × 21 features, fully numerical and ready for EDA, dashboarding, and multiclass ML tasks.

Why This Dataset?

Explore risk distributions and correlations across lifestyle factors
Build visual dashboards for population-level cancer risk
Train multiclass models on Cancer_Type with balanced evaluation (macro-F1, accuracy)
Practice class imbalance handling and interpretability

Targets

Primary target:
Cancer_Type ∈ {Lung, Breast, Colon, Prostate, Skin}
→ Ideal for multiclass classification (use macro-F1, accuracy, confusion matrix).

Optional target:

Risk_Level ∈ {Low, Medium, High}
→ Derived from Overall_Risk_Score thresholds:
Low < 0.35 | 0.35–0.65 = Medium | > 0.65 = High


🔍 Analysis Pipeline

Categorical Features: 

Analyzed variables like Cancer_Type, Risk_Level, Gender, H_Pylori_Infection, and BRCA_Mutation using bar charts.

Most patients fall into Medium or High risk groups.

H_Pylori_Infection and BRCA_Mutation strongly link to specific cancer types.

Chi-Square Test: 

Confirmed strong associations (p < 0.05) between Cancer_Type,

H_Pylori_Infection, and BRCA_Mutation with overall risk level.

Numerical Features: 

Variables: Age, BMI, Smoking, Alcohol_Use, Air_Pollution, Physical_Activity, etc.

High-risk patients → higher BMI, Smoking, and Air Pollution.

Low-risk patients → better Physical Activity and Diet Quality.

Correlation & Feature Importance:

 Top correlated features with overall risk:

 1️⃣ Smoking 2️⃣ Air Pollution 3️⃣ BMI 4️⃣ Age

Data Preparation:

 ✅ Dropped non-predictive IDs

 ✅ One-hot encoded categorical variables

 ✅ Train-test split (80/20)

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Random Forest Classifier:

Accuracy: 96%

Top Predictors: Overall_Risk_Score, Smoking, Air_Pollution, BMI, Age

Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: 85%

✅ Random Forest outperformed across all metrics (F1 ≈ 0.95).

📊 Key Insights

Environmental and lifestyle factors dominate cancer risk.

Smoking, Air Pollution, and Obesity are top contributors.

Exercise and Healthy Diet act as strong protective factors.
